The movement and the levels had to be designed in a way that complemented each other and that allowed the game to achieve the fast-paced and fluid to play. I spent a lot of time refining each compontent of the player's moveset so that it felt quick and responsive, such as the left-right movement having very little acceleration and decelleration times to allow for quick direction changes, and little-to-no end-lag being implemented on the character's moveset so multiple movement options could be chained together. I designed the levels encounter-by-encounter, resulting in a variety of different challenges for the player in one level, whilst also keeping to the same theme and difficulty.",

My most significant contributions were via the development of the audio playing system, which was quite basic in implementation, as it was only regulating when and how many tracks were playing at once, as well as recording, mixing and implementing various audio tracks that combined together to create a non-intrusive, subtle audioscape that aimed to make the user feel relaxed enough to feel sleepy. This included sounds such as ocean noises without the crashing of waves, fire sounds without the peaking and crackling of the fire, subtle narration and chatting that allowed the user to feel comforted without feeling distracted by the sounds.",
